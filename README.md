## Overview

The Cacher modules lets you define and manage file system based caches
on your site.

You can define one or more file caches at different physical locations.

The module is based on Xaraya's file storage caching and includes
functionality to:

  - Create, modify and delete cache definitions
  - Add or remove files from a cache
  - Update cache files when the original file changes
